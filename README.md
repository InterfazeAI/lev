</p>

lev is an open System One decision model and the harness that measures it. Give it a **state** (text, a ticket, an email, or JSON) and a set of typed questions (yes/no, choice, score), and it answers all of them in one forward pass, reading each answer from logits it already computed. It returns calibrated probabilities over exactly the options you supplied and generates no tokens. The model is a LoRA adapter on Qwen3.5-4B; the wire protocol is TypeSafe's `/v1/systemone`, so any TypeSafe client works against it by changing the base URL.

**No generated tokens, no JSON to parse, no retries.** lev cannot return a label outside your options, because the answer space is the option set you send. It can still pick the wrong option: the guarantee is structural, not a guarantee of correctness.

lev and Jev ran through the same harness on all 3,880 items S1Bench scores, pinned by [Nimble](https://github.com/bespokelabsai/nimble)'s manifests. Our Jev run lands within 0.8 points of TypeSafe's published figure on every subset, so the harness is not the gap.

- **Noise:** at these sizes a per-subset difference needs roughly 5–9 points to be real. lev's leads on multinli and helpsteer2 are inside that.
- **Where Jev is clearly ahead:** the minimal-edit pairs (paws −12.4, vitaminc −13.3) and summeval-consistency (−54.1), where lev rates most fully faithful summaries one level low. Fine-tuning introduced that: the untuned backbone scores 0.826.
- **Constant baselines:** on civil_comments (89% not toxic) and the three 5-level rating subsets, always answering the most common label beats both models.
- **Calibration:** mean ECE 0.115 for lev, 0.091 for Jev; lev is better calibrated on 5 of 13.
- **Speed:** 69 ms is lev's engine compute for a short request inside the container. End to end from a laptop, Jev answered in 335–346 ms median and lev on one Modal H100 in 414–654 ms across two runs.

## Quickstart

```bash
pip install "lev[serve] @ git+https://github.com/InterfazeAI/lev#subdirectory=packages/lev"
```

In-process:

```python
import lev

model = lev.load("interfaze-ai/lev")
result = model.system_one(
    "Hi, I was charged twice for my order #4471 and I want a refund.",
    {
        "intent": {
            "type": "choice",
            "instructions": "What does the customer want?",
            "criteria": {
                "refund": "wants money back",
                "cancel": None,
                "track": None,
                "other": None,
            },
        },
        "urgent": {"type": "noul", "instructions": "Does this need a human within the hour?"},
    },
)
result.answers["intent"].choice  # "refund"
result.answers["urgent"].noul  # probability the answer is yes
result.usage.output_tokens  # 0
```

Or as a server, with any TypeSafe client:

```bash
lev serve --checkpoint interfaze-ai/lev --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

```python
from typesafe_sdk import Choice, Noul, TypeSafeClient

client = TypeSafeClient(base_url="http://localhost:8000", api_key="local", timeout=60)
response = client.system_one(
    state={"ticket": "The app crashes every time I open settings."},
    questions={
        "team": Choice(
            instructions="Which team owns this?", criteria={"billing": None, "technical": None}
        ),
        "bug": Noul(instructions="Is this a bug report?"),
    },
)
```

Python 3.12+. `lev.load` and `lev serve` read the release manifest for the base model, prompt format, calibration and head, so there is nothing to configure. The [model card](https://huggingface.co/interfaze-ai/lev) has the full walkthrough with real outputs.

```

Each option gets a short code, and the answer is read from the next-token logits over those codes. Choices are read in two option orders and averaged, which cancels position bias. Codes that would split into two tokens are skipped, so this reaches several hundred options.

**The router is the part nobody else had.** Every other implementation picks one readout family and hits a wall when options stop fitting in single tokens: it caps the option count or rejects the request. lev routes those questions to a small learned head that matches the state against each option's text, so there is no fixed option ceiling. [ADR-005 →](docs/DECISIONS.md#adr-005--dual-mode-readout-the-differentiator)

**Calibration is a first-class objective, not a post-processing step.** Open reproductions reached Jev-level accuracy before they reached its calibration, and the best-calibrated open model got there by fitting a single temperature after training. lev fits one per question type, readout mode and choice option-count band. On a held-out split of the 29 training sources that took expected calibration error from 0.180 to 0.061; the shipped temperatures were then re-selected by how well they carry over to task families left out of the fit.

## The optimizations that mattered

<p align="center"><img src="hf/assets/compute.png" alt="lev compute per call on one H100: 169 ms to 69 ms" width="100%"></p>

**One batched forward instead of prefill-and-fork: 169 → 69 ms.** The design prefilled the state once and forked the cache per question. Measured on an H100, the forward pass at this size is bound by kernel launches, not arithmetic, so the fork saved FLOPs and cost time. One batched forward over prefix and suffix per row, plus the depthwise-conv kernel, cut compute by 59%, and it stays flat from one question to eight. `torch.compile` was measured slower on this hybrid model and is off. [ADR-023 →](docs/DECISIONS.md#adr-023--one-batched-forward-not-prefill-and-fork)

**Label-token readout up to the tokenizer's limit: +51 points on MASSIVE's 60 intents.** Training capped label-token readout so the head kept its data, and serving had inherited that cap. Serving 60 options through label codes instead of the head took accuracy from 0.231 to 0.746. [ADR-025 →](docs/DECISIONS.md#adr-025--serving-routes-mode-a-up-to-the-tokenizer-limit-training-keeps-its-cap)

**Skipping codes that split: banking77 0.818 → 0.980.** On this tokenizer the 69th code, `BQ`, is two tokens, which capped label-token readout at 68 options. Passing over split codes lifts the limit to several hundred and moved banking77 and clinc_oos (151 intents) onto the stronger readout. [ADR-028 →](docs/DECISIONS.md#adr-028--skip-split-label-codes-when-serving-calibrate-for-families-the-model-has-not-seen)

**The backbone's own prompt format: 0.653 → 0.710 frozen.** The untuned instruct model scored 5.7 points higher on the earlier six-subset S1Bench set when questions are dressed in its chat template, so the final run trained in that format. [ADR-027 →](docs/DECISIONS.md#adr-027--the-prompt-is-dressed-in-the-backbones-own-format)

## Measure it yourself

`levbench` measures lev, Jev, and any `/v1/systemone`-compatible server through the same code path: one changed flag.

```bash
levbench eval  --backend jev                       # the hosted API
levbench eval  --backend lev  --tasks data/eval    # us, on localhost:8000
levbench compare                                   # vs an LLM baseline
levbench sweep                                     # batching economics
levbench confidence                                # which statistic is `confidence`?
```

It reports accuracy, log loss, Brier, **ECE with reliability bins**, selective accuracy, p50 latency, tokens, cost, and schema-retry counts; its test suite runs offline against a fake transport, with no key. Omit `--tasks` and you get a built-in 24-item fixture, which is a smoke test: at n=24 the 95% interval is **±16 accuracy points**. `make eval-set` writes the real held-out set and `make s1bench` the S1Bench subsets. [ADR-015 →](docs/DECISIONS.md#adr-015--the-24-item-task-set-is-a-fixture-not-a-benchmark)

`levbench` deliberately does **not** depend on `lev`. A measuring instrument that imports the thing it measures is not an instrument. [ADR-010 →](docs/DECISIONS.md#adr-010--two-packages-one-workspace)

## Watch it decide

The model plays Snake, one `/v1/systemone` call per move: laya-mlx's demo, ported so it runs against any System One server through the same client the benchmark uses.

```bash
uv sync --extra demo
uv run levbench snake --backend planner                        # no server: the planner plays
make snake URL=https://<your-serve-url>                        # lev
uv run levbench snake --backend jev --steps 200 --record artifacts/snake/jev.jsonl
uv run levbench replay artifacts/snake/jev.jsonl              # play it back at original speed
```

The display shows the board, the four direction probabilities with the model's pick marked and unsafe moves flagged, and the model's dead-end-risk and food-reachability estimates beside the planner's ground truth. **By default a planner shield overrules an unsafe first choice** and the display marks it `SHIELD`; `--unassisted` removes the shield, so deaths end the run. In the compact prompt the state text _states_ the Noul answers, so the running Noul score is the cheapest test there is of whether a model reads its question.

## Train it yourself

```bash
make setup     # uv sync, no torch, no GPU
make test      # the full suite: no GPU, no network, no API keys
make plan PRESET=4b-instruct
```

```text
model            Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B  (4.0B, bfloat16)
adaptation       LoRA r32
prompt           chat prompts, Mode A to the tokenizer limit
data             200,000 examples x 128 tok x 3 epochs  = 0.08B tokens
steps            18,750 (32 ex/step, ~4,096 tok/step)
compute          2.46e+18 FLOPs
H100 estimate    1.7 hours (0.1 days)
memory           8.3 GB state, 71.7 GB headroom of 80 GB
```

The 128-token figure is measured over 1,500 real rendered prompts, not assumed; `lev plan --data data/mixture` re-measures it against your mixture. Then:

```bash
make setup-train                 # torch, transformers, peft
make data                        # 29 public sources -> train / calibration / test
make smoke-local STEPS=20        # prove the path on 0.8B, on CPU, before spending a GPU
make train PRESET=4b-instruct    # Modal, one H100
make calibrate PRESET=4b-instruct
scripts/publish_hf.sh            # package, load-check on an H100, publish to a private Hub repo
```

The data build refuses any source that resolves to one of the 13 S1Bench subsets. [SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md) covers Modal, [TRAINING.md](docs/TRAINING.md) the pipeline, and [STATUS.md](docs/STATUS.md) what has been run.

## Boundaries worth understanding

- **Finite typed answers only.** Yes/no, one of N options, or a score over 2–10 levels. No free text, nested schemas or unbounded numbers.
- **Questions are answered independently.** Answers in one request do not condition on each other. Encode a joint decision as one choice, or ask in stages.
- **Minimal edits and fine-grained ratings are weak.** Inputs that differ by one swapped word or number, and quality ratings over five levels, are where lev is least accurate and can be confidently wrong.
- **Calibration is fitted on the training distribution.** Temperatures are chosen to transfer across task families, but a task very unlike the training mix may be less well calibrated. Check on your own data before gating on the probabilities.
- **English only**, and a GPU for real-time use, compatible with CPU with a far slower inference.

Benchmark data is a snapshot of a third-party S1Bench dashboard (`data/s1bench-snapshot.json`) that I did not produce; its caveats are in [FINDINGS.md §9](docs/FINDINGS.md). The 13 subset definitions (item ids, label counts, instructions and criteria) come from Nimble's public-benchmark manifests at commit `62076b4`, vendored in `packages/lev/src/lev/data/s1bench_subsets/`.
